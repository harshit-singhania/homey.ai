AGENTS.md — Homey.ai

Homey.ai is a Telegram-first conversational surveillance system that turns a smartphone camera into an intelligent safety monitor. Users interact entirely through natural language via Telegram. The system detects activity, summarizes scene state, and responds to user queries.

Overview

Homey.ai is built with agentic components that perform distinct roles:
	1.	Perception Agent – Visual scene understanding on device
	2.	Communication Agent – Telegram message handling
	3.	Conversation Agent – Natural language interpretation & response
	4.	Event Agent – Incident detection & alert generation
	5.	Decision Gatekeeper – Safety checks & human-in-loop escalation

This document describes each agent’s role, responsibilities, and boundaries.

1. Perception Agent

Purpose

Extract structured visual and activity information from the surveillance phone’s camera feed.

Responsibilities
	•	Run object detection (e.g., using YOLOv10)
	•	Infer presence of people, animals, motion
	•	Generate structured scene descriptors (object type, bounding box, confidence)

Modes
	•	Offline Mode — inference runs completely locally
	•	Online Mode — enhanced models used via cloud APIs when internet is available

Output

A structured JSON scene description, e.g.:

{
  "timestamp": 1627635123,
  "objects": [
    { "type": "person", "confidence": 0.78 },
    { "type": "cat", "confidence": 0.85 }
  ],
  "motion": true
}

Rules
	•	No facial recognition
	•	No identification of individuals
	•	No emotional inference

⸻

2. Communication Agent

Purpose

Interface with Telegram using the Telegram Bot API to receive and send messages.

Responsibilities
	•	Listen to incoming Telegram updates (messages, callbacks)
	•	Normalize user messages (text, media, inline keyboard responses)
	•	Deliver messages to the Conversation Agent
	•	Send replies back to users
	•	Format structured responses (text, images, inline keyboards)

Constraints
	•	All interactions are user-initiated or alert-triggered
	•	No unsolicited messaging except event alerts
	•	Must respect Telegram Bot API rate limits

⸻

3. Conversation Agent

Purpose

Interpret user intent and generate responses grounded in scene data or history.

Responsibilities
	•	Parse natural language requests
	•	Map queries to system actions (status, snapshot, explanation)
	•	Use LLM(s) for interpretation and text generation
	•	Follow domain-specific rules for surveillance communication

Examples

User → “Hey Homey, how are things at home?”
Response → “No unusual activity. Last motion detected 3h ago.”

User → “Can you see my cat?”
Response → “Yes. A cat is present at 02:14 PM in the center of the room.”

Safety Boundaries
	•	Descriptive responses only
	•	No medical or emotional judgments
	•	No inference about identity

⸻

4. Event Agent

Purpose

Monitor perception outputs over time and detect noteworthy events.

Responsibilities
	•	Track scene changes and motion history
	•	Apply rule-based logic for alerts
	•	Assign confidence scores to events
	•	Trigger alert messages via the Communication Agent

Alert Triggers

Examples:
	•	Motion when the user is “away”
	•	Presence of a person during restricted hours
	•	Repeated activity above a threshold

Alert Message Format

Alerts use Telegram inline keyboards for quick responses:

```
⚠️ Motion detected at 02:14 AM
Objects: person (78%)

[VIEW]  [IGNORE]
```
(Inline keyboard buttons below the message)


⸻

5. Decision Gatekeeper

Purpose

Act as the human-in-the-loop control layer to prevent unsafe or autonomous actions.

Responsibilities
	•	Validate responses before sending
	•	Enforce safety policies
	•	Confirm escalations only after explicit user consent

No-Action Rules
	•	The system must not contact law enforcement
	•	Must not autonomously call emergency services
	•	Must not label emotional or medical states

The Decision Gatekeeper can prompt the user:

Reply YES to confirm escalation
Reply NO to ignore

            Communication Agent ──> User


⸻

Closed-Loop Cases

Status Query
	1.	User: “How are things at home?”
	2.	Conversation Agent interprets intent
	3.	Perception Agent retrieves latest scene
	4.	Decision Gatekeeper formats response
	4.	Communication Agent sends it to Telegram

Alert Trigger
	1.	Perception Agent detects motion
	2.	Event Agent evaluates severity
	3.	Decision Gatekeeper creates alert
	4.	Communication Agent pushes alert message

⸻

Safety and Ethical Boundaries

Homey.ai must follow ethical guidelines:

Restriction	Reason
No facial recognition	Privacy, legal risks
No emotional inference	Safety, liability
No autonomous enforcement	Prevent misuse
No public space monitoring	Consent required

All agents enforce these boundaries.

⸻

Notes on Offline vs Online intelligence
	•	Offline: Perception Agent uses local, lightweight models
	•	Online: Enhanced reasoning via cloud LLMs and vision APIs
	•	Conversation Agent blends both gracefully

Users should not notice backend mode changes.

⸻

Glossary
	•	Scene Descriptor: Structured representation of what was seen
	•	Alert: Event notification to user
	•	Inline Keyboard: Telegram interactive buttons below messages
	•	Callback Query: User interaction with inline keyboard buttons

⸻

Deployment Considerations
	•	Webhook listener must be reachable (HTTPS) or use long-polling for development
	•	Surveillance phone must run inference service (e.g., Android background agent)
	•	Communication Agent must handle retries
	•	Logging must respect privacy

⸻

Detailed Agent Specifications
-----------------------------

### Communication Agent

The Communication Agent handles all message transport between users and the system. It uses the Telegram Bot API (production) and supports a mock transport (development/testing).

Interface Protocol
````python
class MessageTransport(Protocol):
    async def receive(self, raw_payload: dict) -> IncomingMessage: ...
    async def send(self, user_id: str, message: OutgoingMessage) -> bool: ...

class MockTransport(MessageTransport):
    """For local dev & testing - REST-based interface"""

class TelegramTransport(MessageTransport):
    """Real Telegram Bot API integration using python-telegram-bot"""
````

Message Schemas
````python
class IncomingMessage(BaseModel):
    message_id: int
    sender_telegram_id: int
    sender_username: str | None
    timestamp: datetime
    type: Literal["text", "photo", "callback_query", "location"]
    content: str | None
    media_file_id: str | None  # Telegram's file_id for photos/documents
    callback_data: str | None  # Data from inline keyboard button press

class OutgoingMessage(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["text", "photo", "interactive"]
    text: str | None
    photo_file_id: str | None  # Can reuse existing file_id or upload new
    photo_url: str | None       # Upload from URL
    inline_keyboard: list[list[InlineKeyboardButton]] | None
    parse_mode: Literal["HTML", "Markdown"] | None = None

class InlineKeyboardButton(BaseModel):
    text: str  # Button label (no strict length limit like WhatsApp)
    callback_data: str  # Data returned when pressed (max 64 bytes)
````

Responsibilities:
- Validate bot token and handle updates securely
- Parse message types: text, photo, callback_query, location
- Extract sender telegram_id, username, timestamp, message_id
- Normalize to IncomingMessage schema
- Deduplicate using update_id (automatic in python-telegram-bot)
- Format outgoing messages for transport
- Handle Telegram rate limiting (30 msg/sec to same user, 20 msg/min to groups)
- Support both webhook (production) and long-polling (development)
- Track message delivery

API Endpoints:
- POST /webhooks/telegram - Receive Telegram updates (webhook mode)
- POST /api/v1/mock/send - Simulate user sending message (mock only)
- GET /api/v1/mock/messages - View sent messages (mock only)

---

### Conversation Agent

The Conversation Agent uses Google Gemini to interpret user intent and generate contextual responses grounded in scene data and event history.

Intent Classification
````python
class UserIntent(Enum):
    STATUS_CHECK = "status_check"        # "How are things?"
    OBJECT_QUERY = "object_query"        # "Can you see my cat?"
    SNAPSHOT_REQUEST = "snapshot"        # "Send me a picture"
    ALERT_ACKNOWLEDGE = "alert_ack"      # "VIEW", "IGNORE"
    ESCALATION_CONFIRM = "escalate"      # "YES", "NO"
    HELP = "help"                        # "What can you do?"
    SETTINGS = "settings"                # "Turn off alerts"
    GREETING = "greeting"                # "Hi", "Hello"
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"
````

System Prompt Template
````python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are Homey, a friendly and concise home monitoring assistant.

## Your Capabilities
- Report current scene status (what objects are visible, motion detected)
- Describe what's happening at home based on camera data
- Send alerts when unusual activity occurs
- Answer questions about recent events

## Communication Style
- Be concise: 1-2 sentences for simple queries
- Be friendly but professional
- Use present tense for current state ("A cat is visible")
- Use past tense for events ("Motion was detected at 2:14 PM")

## Strict Rules (NEVER violate)
1. NEVER identify specific individuals ("your wife", "John") - only say "a person"
2. NEVER make emotional judgments ("looks worried", "seems upset")
3. NEVER suggest calling police or emergency services
4. NEVER diagnose medical conditions
5. NEVER share information about one user with another
6. If unsure, say "I'm not sure" rather than guessing

## Context
Current time: {current_time}
User status: {user_status}
User name: {user_name}

## Latest Scene Data
Camera: {camera_name}
Last updated: {scene_timestamp}
Objects detected: {objects_list}
Motion: {motion_status}

## Recent Events (last 24h)
{recent_events}
"""
````

Intent Classification Prompt
````python
INTENT_PROMPT = """Classify the user's intent from their message.

Possible intents:
- STATUS_CHECK: User asking about current home status ("how are things?", "what's happening?")
- OBJECT_QUERY: User asking about specific object/person ("is my cat there?", "anyone home?")
- SNAPSHOT_REQUEST: User wants to see an image ("show me", "send a picture")
- ALERT_ACK: User responding to alert ("VIEW", "IGNORE", "OK")
- ESCALATION_CONFIRM: User confirming/denying escalation ("YES", "NO")
- SETTINGS: User changing preferences ("turn off alerts", "set status to away")
- HELP: User asking what you can do ("help", "what can you do?")
- GREETING: Casual greeting ("hi", "hello")
- UNKNOWN: Cannot determine intent

User message: "{message}"

Respond with ONLY the intent name, nothing else."""
````

Response Templates
````python
RESPONSE_TEMPLATES = {
    "STATUS_CHECK": {
        "no_activity": "All quiet at home. No motion detected since {last_motion_time}.",
        "objects_present": "{object_list} {verb} currently visible. {motion_status}",
        "motion_only": "Motion detected {time_ago}. No specific objects identified.",
    },
    "OBJECT_QUERY": {
        "found": "Yes, {object_type} is visible in the {location}. Confidence: {confidence}%.",
        "not_found": "I don't see {object_type} right now. Last seen: {last_seen}.",
        "never_seen": "I haven't detected {object_type} in recent history.",
    },
    "HELP": """Here's what I can do:
• "How are things?" - Get current status
• "Is my cat there?" - Check for specific objects
• "Send a picture" - Request snapshot
• "Set status to away" - Enable away mode alerts
• "Turn off alerts" - Disable notifications""",
}
````

Few-Shot Examples
````python
FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = [
    {
        "scene": {"objects": [{"type": "cat", "confidence": 0.92}], "motion": False},
        "user": "How are things at home?",
        "response": "All quiet! Your cat is lounging around. No unusual activity."
    },
    {
        "scene": {"objects": [{"type": "person", "confidence": 0.78}], "motion": True},
        "user": "What's happening?",
        "response": "Motion detected. A person is currently visible in frame."
    },
    {
        "scene": {"objects": [], "motion": False},
        "user": "Can you see my dog?",
        "response": "I don't see a dog right now. The area appears empty."
    },
]
````

Processing Flow:
1. IncomingMessage from Communication Agent
2. Intent Classification → Gemini with few-shot examples
3. Context Retrieval → Latest scene, user preferences, conversation history
4. Response Generation → Gemini with system prompt + context
5. Safety Check → Gatekeeper validates
6. OutgoingMessage → Communication Agent

---

### Event Agent

The Event Agent monitors perception outputs over time and detects noteworthy events using a rule-based alert system.

Alert Rules Engine
````python
class AlertTrigger(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["motion", "object_detected", "object_absent", "no_motion"]
    object_type: str | None      # For object triggers: "person", "cat", etc.
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.7

class AlertCondition(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["time_range", "user_status", "day_of_week"]
    value: str | dict            # "22:00-06:00" or {"status": "away"}

class AlertRule(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    enabled: bool = True
    trigger: AlertTrigger
    conditions: list[AlertCondition]
    cooldown_seconds: int = 300  # Prevent alert spam
    severity: Literal["low", "medium", "high"]
````

Default Rules
````python
DEFAULT_RULES = [
    AlertRule(
        id="motion_when_away",
        name="Motion while away",
        trigger=AlertTrigger(type="motion"),
        conditions=[AlertCondition(type="user_status", value={"status": "away"})],
        severity="medium"
    ),
    AlertRule(
        id="person_at_night",
        name="Person detected at night",
        trigger=AlertTrigger(type="object_detected", object_type="person"),
        conditions=[AlertCondition(type="time_range", value="22:00-06:00")],
        severity="high"
    ),
    AlertRule(
        id="package_detected",
        name="Package detected",
        trigger=AlertTrigger(type="object_detected", object_type="package"),
        conditions=[],
        severity="low"
    ),
]
````

Event Processing Flow:
1. Scene received from Perception Agent
2. Evaluate all enabled alert rules against scene
3. Check conditions (time, user status, etc.)
4. Check cooldown (prevent alert spam)
5. If match → Create Event → Send to Gatekeeper

Alert Message Format:
````text
⚠️ Motion detected at 02:14 AM
Objects: person (78%)

[VIEW]  [IGNORE]
(Inline keyboard buttons)
````

---

### Decision Gatekeeper

The Decision Gatekeeper enforces safety policies and validates all outgoing content before it reaches the user.

Safety Policies
````python
class SafetyPolicy:
    """Enforces ethical boundaries on all outgoing content"""

    BLOCKED_PATTERNS = [
        r"call.*police", r"call.*911", r"emergency services",
        r"looks (sad|angry|scared|anxious|depressed)",
        r"(your|the) (friend|family|wife|husband|child)",  # No identity inference
    ]

    async def validate_response(self, response: str, context: dict) -> ValidationResult:
        # Check for blocked patterns
        # Verify response is descriptive, not prescriptive
        # Ensure no PII leakage
        # Return validated response or redacted version

    async def check_escalation_safety(self, event: Event) -> bool:
        # Never allow automatic escalation to law enforcement
        # Require explicit user consent for high-severity actions
        return False  # Always require user confirmation
````

Escalation Flow:
````text
High-severity event detected
    ↓

Testing Strategy
----------------

Unit Tests
- pytest for individual agent logic
- Mock all external dependencies (Gemini, Telegram, Database)

Integration Tests
- Test agent coordination with mock transport
- Test end-to-end conversation flows

E2E Tests
- Simulate full conversation flows via mock API
- Test real Telegram integration (in staging environment)

Load Tests
- Locust for concurrent message handling
- Test database query performance under load

Example Test Scenario
````python
async def test_status_check_flow():
    # 1. Mock perception returns scene with cat
    # 2. Simulate user message: "How are things at home?"
    # 3. Assert response mentions the cat and no unusual activity
    # 4. Assert message logged to DB

## Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** February 4, 2026

### ✅ Completed

#### Phase 1: Telegram Transport Migration (Feb 4, 2026)
All WhatsApp Business API code has been successfully migrated to Telegram Bot API:

**Files Modified:**
- `app/models/message.py` - Updated to Telegram message schemas (InlineKeyboardButton, telegram_id)
- `app/models/user.py` - Changed User model: `phone_number` → `telegram_id` (BIGINT)
- `app/services/telegram.py` - **NEW** Telegram Bot API client with rate limiting
- `app/agents/communication.py` - Replaced WhatsAppTransport with TelegramTransport
- `app/api/webhooks.py` - Updated to `POST /webhooks/telegram`
- `app/config.py` - Removed WhatsApp configs, added Telegram settings
- `.env.example` - Updated environment variable documentation
- `requirements.txt` - Added `python-telegram-bot>=21.0`

**Migration Details:**
- User identification: `phone_number` → `telegram_id` (BIGINT)
- Message buttons: `QuickReplyButton` → `InlineKeyboardButton`
- Callback handling: Now supports `callback_query` for inline keyboard interactions
- Message types: text, photo, callback_query, location
- Transport modes: Mock (for testing) and Telegram (production)

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Message models aligned with Telegram API
- ✅ Database schema updated (migration pending)
- ✅ Telegram transport implementation complete
- ✅ Mock transport updated for testing
- ✅ Webhook endpoint ready for Telegram Updates
- ✅ All agents use new Telegram schemas

### 🚧 In Progress / Pending

**Database Migration:**
- Schema changes defined but migration not yet created
- Need to run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migrate to Telegram"`
- Then: `alembic upgrade head`

**Agent Integration:**
- Webhook endpoint receives updates but doesn't process them yet
- Need orchestrator to connect: Webhook → Communication → Conversation → Gatekeeper → Response

**Camera Upload Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/cameras/{id}/scenes` - Not implemented
- `POST /api/v1/cameras/{id}/snapshots` - Not implemented
- `GET /api/v1/cameras/{id}/status` - Not implemented

**Testing:**
- No unit tests written yet
- No integration tests written yet
- Test directories exist but are empty

**Background Tasks:**
- Celery worker referenced but not implemented
- Scene processing pipeline not built
- Event detection loop not running

### 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migrate to Telegram"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Get Telegram Bot Token**
   - Message @BotFather on Telegram
   - Run `/newbot` command
   - Configure `.env` with token

3. **Build Webhook Integration**
   - Create orchestrator to handle Telegram updates
   - Connect Communication → Conversation → Gatekeeper → Response
   - Test end-to-end message flow

4. **Implement Camera Endpoints**
   - Scene upload from Android app
   - Snapshot image handling
   - Heartbeat monitoring

5. **Add Database Persistence**
   - Save scenes to database
   - Store conversations and messages
   - User lookup and creation

6. **Write Tests**
   - Unit tests for agents
   - Integration tests for message flow
   - E2E tests with mock transport

7. **Background Tasks**
   - Implement Celery worker
   - Scene processing pipeline
   - Periodic event detection

### 📝 Notes

- **Transport Selection:** System now supports Telegram (production) and Mock (testing)
- **Breaking Changes:** All WhatsApp-specific code has been removed
- **Backwards Compatibility:** None - this is a complete migration
- **Testing:** Use `TRANSPORT=mock` for local development without Telegram bot
